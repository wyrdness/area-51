      "summary": "A highly classified United States Air Force facility in Nevada, center of UFO conspiracy theories, officially confirmed to exist in 2013. Known for testing classified aircraft and alleged alien technology.",
      "full": "Area 51 is a highly classified remote detachment of Edwards Air Force Base located in the Nevada Test and Training Range, approximately 83 miles north-northwest of Las Vegas. Officially known as Groom Lake, the facility has been the center of UFO conspiracy theories since the 1950s. The U.S. government did not officially acknowledge its existence until 2013 when the CIA released declassified documents confirming the base was used for testing the U-2 spy plane and other classified aircraft including the SR-71 Blackbird and stealth technology. Conspiracy theories allege the facility stores alien spacecraft, reverse-engineers extraterrestrial technology, and houses alien bodies recovered from Roswell. Notable claims include Bob Lazar's 1989 testimony about working on alien propulsion systems. The 2019 'Storm Area 51' viral event brought renewed attention. While the base's existence and role in aircraft testing is confirmed, UFO and alien-related claims remain unverified."
